                <h2>What Happens After Coming Soon?</h2>
                <p>For months, you've told everyone that your amazing site is 'coming soon'. Then you finally go live...Now What?</p>
                <p style='margin-top:30px;'>Now's the time to engage with and learn about your leads using activity tracking and measuring.</p>
                <p>This can be a slow, painful process.</p>
                <p>The good news is that the process can be made much easier with Easy Pie's <strong>Lead Watch</strong> plugin.</p>
                <h3>Lead Watch Helps You More Effectively Engage Your Leads</h3>
