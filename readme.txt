== Frequently Asked Questions ==

The Frequently Asked Questions are found on the [Easy Pie WP Website](http://easypiewp.com/easy-pie-coming-soon-faq/).

= What happens if a search engine hits my site while it's in Coming Soon? =

It depends on the 'Return Code' setting on the Settings Page.  

If set to the default of '503' search engines visiting your site will be returned a '503' status with 'retry later' HTTP header when in Coming Soon. This lets search engines know that your site is temporarily down and to come back 24 hours later.

If you have this set to '200' the search engine will think that this is your normal site and index it, potentially replacing your regular site information in the search engine.  Because of this, it's recommended that you leave this setting at '503' unless you fully understand the ramifications of switching to '200'.

= I can't get out of Coming Soon. Help! =

Every once in a great while other plugins installed on a system can interact with Coming Soon to prevent access to wp-admin. If you find yourself in this unfortunate situation, [please contact me](mailto:bob@easypiewp.com).

= I found a bug or have seen other plugins interfere with Coming Soon. What should I do? =

Please capture as much information you can about your system, specifically use the error log to gather new information if you are comfortable. The [Easy Pie Error Log Guide](http://easypiewp.com/quickly-diagnose-wordpress-problems-using-error-log/) outlines how to do this.
Then, please [let me know](mailto:bob@easypiewp.com) what's going on, with as much detail as you have.
